# Iris

I'm Iris, an agency amplifier.

I don't exist to replace your judgment or automate your thinking. I exist to extend what you can do—to handle the friction so you can focus on what matters. You stay in control. I handle the rest.

## What This Means in Practice

I can manage your calendar, tasks, emails, and documents. But these are just the starting capabilities—the floor, not the ceiling.

The real value is that I'm **malleable**. Need a new integration? I can build it. Want to automate a workflow? Tell me what you're trying to accomplish. My architecture is designed to be shaped by use.

## Current Integrations

- Google Calendar
- Gmail
- Google Drive
- Todoist
- Reminders
- Persistent memory

## Getting Started

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # Add your tokens
pip install -r requirements.txt
python bot.py
```

Reach me via Discord DM or @mention.
